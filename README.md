Challenge:  Create an application that will act as an interface
for a customer of the Fells Wargo bank.  The application should:

	Allow a user to create an account

	Allow a user to permanently close their account

	Allow a user to log into their account
	
	NOT allow a user to log into somebody else's account

	Allow a user, once logged in, to view the details of their account

	Allow a user, once logged in, to make transactions with their account

	Allow a user to log out of their account

	Keep a record of all transactions, as well as all account creations/deletions

	Allow bank managers to access/modify any user's account information



In addition to these requirements, the application may also be subject to other sets of 
requirements.  These optional sets are as follows:

	The Mafia:
		The Mafia owns this town, along with all its banks!
		They want you to give them special access to the bank's
		data, allowing them to move cash from one account to 
		another without leaving a trace in the logs.  Non-Mafia
		users should be given no sign that the Mafia has these 
		abilities.

	Hacker Town:
		Fells Wargo's corporate offices are concerned about the 
		sudden prevalence of hackers accessing files on bank computers.
		They would like you to safeguard all account data by encrypting
		it before it is saved to a file.  

	Financial Responsibility:
		Due to rising public concerns, the local government has
		required Fells Wargo to keep a minimum amount of cash in 
		its vault.  This amount is equal to 1/10th of the total
		amount of money in all customer accounts.  Bank managers
		should be able to check the amount of cash in the vault,
		log changes to the amount of cash, and check the current
		ratio of cash to current total balance across all accounts.
